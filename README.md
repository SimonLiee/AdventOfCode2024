# Advent of Code 2024

My solution to Advent of Code 2024.
Done in Typescript using [Deno 2.0](https://deno.com/)

# How to run

Make sure you have [Deno 2.0](https://deno.com/) installed

Navigate to the day you want to run e.g.:

```cd Day1```

Then do:

```deno run --allow-read Part1.ts```

Change Part1.ts to Part2.ts if you want to run Part2.
